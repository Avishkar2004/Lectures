const fs  = require("fs") 
The node:fs module enables interacting with the file system in a way modeled on standard POSIX functions.

To use the promise-based APIs:

import * as fs from 'node:fs/promises';
To use the callback and sync APIs:

import * as fs from 'node:fs';
All file system operations have synchronous, callback, and promise-based forms, and are accessible using both CommonJS syntax and ES6 Modules (ESM).


const fs  = require("fs")
//synchronous call
fs.writeFileSync('./text.txt', "hey There")

this will generate text.txt file in our folder when we run this code
