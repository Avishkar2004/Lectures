What is backend ?
Web development activities that are done at the back end of programs are referred to as back end development. Back-end development covers server-side web application logic and integration and activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with system components instead of frontend development, which focuses on customer-facing services and programs.

What is a database?
Database is the collection of organized data which is structured and is stored electronically on a computer system. Databases can store data in the form of tables depending upon the type of database. The database's primary goal is to store a huge amount of data.
Data can then be accessed, managed, updated, regulated, and organized efficiently. For writing and retrieving data, most databases utilize structured query language (SQL).

What is Database Management System(DBMS) ?
A database management system is software that manages a database by storing, retrieving, and manipulating the data from a database. Oracle, MySQL etc are well-known DBMS tools. Some functions of Database Management System are:

-various activies creation, deletion and modification of the data.
-a database management system (DBMS) allows users to design databases that meet their specific needs.
-is a collection of programs that respond to user commands.

Types of DBMS
There are several types of database management systems. Here is a list of eight common database management systems:

Hierarchical databases
Network databases
Relational databases
Object-oriented databases
Graph databases
ER model databases
Document databases
NoSQL databases

1.Hierarchical Databases
In a hierarchical database management system (hierarchical DBMSs) model, data is stored in a parent-children relationship node. In a hierarchical database, besides actual data, records also contain information about their groups of parent/child relationships.

2.Network Databases
Network database management systems (Network DBMSs) use a network structure to create a relationship between entities. Network databases are mainly used on large digital computers.

3.Relational Databases
In a relational database management system (RDBMS), the relationship between data is relational and data is stored in tabular form of columns and rows.

4.Object-Oriented Model
we have to discuss the functionality of object-oriented Programming. It takes more than the storage of programming language objects. It provides full-featured database programming capabilities while containing native language compatibility.

What is a non-relational database?
A non-relational database, sometimes called NoSQL (Not Only SQL), is any kind of database that doesnâ€™t use the tables, fields, and columns structured data concept from relational databases. Non-relational databases have been designed with the cloud in mind, making them great at horizontal scaling.

XAMPP
1.Apache: is open source web server Apache is the most widely used server worldwide for delivery of web content. The server application is made available as a free software by the Apache Software Foundation.

2.MySQL/MariaDB: MySQL, XAMPP contains one of the most popular relational database management systems in the world. In combination with the web server Apache and the scripting language PHP, MySQL offers data storage for web services.

3.PHP: the server-side programming language PHP enables users to create dynamic websites or applications. PHP can be installed on all platforms and supports a number of diverse database systems.

4.Perl: the scripting language Perl is used in system administration, web development, and network programming. Like PHP, Perl also enables users to program dynamic web applications.

Interview Questions
What is DBMS?
DBMS is a collection of programs that facilitates users to create and maintain a database. In other words, DBMS provides us an interface or tool for performing different operations such as the creation of a database, inserting data into it, deleting data from it, updating the data, etc. DBMS is a software in which data is stored in a more secure way as compared to the file-based system.

What is RDBMS?
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management Systems. It is used to maintain the data records and indices in tables.

What are NoSQL Databases?
Non-Relational Databases are also called No-SQL databases, that doesn't require any table, fields, or records. This type of database has existed since the 1960s, but the term No-SQL was coined in the late 90's and early 21'st century.
-NoSQL databases are completely different from SQL databases and work differently. It has to deal with semi-structured or unstructured data.
-Facebook(Meta) is a very popular example of using NoSQL databases.

There are various types of Non-relational databases like:
Documents Databases.
Graph Databases.
Wide Column Databases.
Key-value Databases.
